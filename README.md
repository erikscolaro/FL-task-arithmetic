# FL-task-arithmetic
This project explores how to merge locally fine-tuned models in Federated Learning using model-editing techniques like Task Arithmetic. The goal is to integrate decentralized updates into a single global model while preserving quality and minimizing interference, without accessing raw data.and maintain high model quality in decentralized settings.
